Frequently asked questions are also answered there.

## Installation

First download the latest version and put it on your linux machine where weewx is running. Then install it via wee_extension: `wee_extension --install=neowx-1.0.zip`.
Edit the `weewx.conf` (located in most cases at `/etc/weewx/weewx.conf` or `/home/weewx/weewx.conf`) section `[StdReport]` -> `[[StandardReport]]` -> `skin` (ca. line 149) and set `skin = neowx`. Restart weewx `sudo service weewx stop && sudo service weewx start`. 

## Install fonts

This theme is using the Roboto font for graph generation. The used fonts and paths are specified in the `skin.conf` at the `[ImageGenerator]` section (ca. line 341). Make sure that the Roboto font is installed and available at the path. If necessary adjust the paths or change the font at all.

On debian based systems you can install the font with `sudo apt install fonts-roboto` and it will be installed at the specified path. 

## Uninstall

Just use wee_extension again: `wee_extension --uninstall=neowx`. But you can also manually change the skin defined in `weewx.conf` and remove the skin/neowx directory.
